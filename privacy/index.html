            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Stack &amp; Blast ("the App") is developed and published by Piotr Gebski ("we", "us", "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how information is handled when you use our App.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and your choices regarding that data.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
            <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device using the iOS UserDefaults system. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gameplay statistics</strong> &mdash; total games played, total score, total blasts, pieces placed, highest combo, highest single-game score</li>
                <li><strong>High scores</strong> &mdash; best score per game mode (Classic, Daily Challenge, Blast Rush)</li>
                <li><strong>User preferences</strong> &mdash; sound on/off, haptics on/off, colorblind mode, selected grid size, active skin theme</li>
                <li><strong>Onboarding state</strong> &mdash; whether you have completed the tutorial</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Challenge state</strong> &mdash; whether today's challenge has been completed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not create user accounts, and no login or registration is required.</p>

            <h3>Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
            <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)</li>
                <li>Location data (precise or coarse)</li>
                <li>Contacts or calendar data</li>
                <li>Photos, camera, or microphone access</li>
                <li>Health or fitness data</li>
                <li>Financial or payment information</li>
                <li>Browsing or search history</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

            <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
            <p>The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements, including optional rewarded video ads (for example, to activate the bomb continue feature or double your score after a game) and periodic interstitial ads between games.</p>
            <p>Google AdMob may collect certain information as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> &mdash; such as the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), subject to your App Tracking Transparency (ATT) consent</li>
                <li><strong>Usage data</strong> &mdash; ad interaction data (impressions, taps)</li>
                <li><strong>Diagnostic data</strong> &mdash; crash logs and performance data related to ad delivery</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google AdMob. Google processes this data in accordance with their own privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Firebase Analytics</h3>
            <p>The App uses Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data that helps us understand how players interact with the game and improve the experience. Firebase Analytics may collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>App usage events</strong> &mdash; such as game starts, game completions, feature usage, and in-app purchase events</li>
                <li><strong>Device information</strong> &mdash; device model, operating system version, and app version</li>
                <li><strong>Performance data</strong> &mdash; app launch time and responsiveness metrics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is collected anonymously and is not linked to your personal identity. For more information, see <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy Information</a>.</p>

            <h3>Apple Game Center</h3>
            <p>The App integrates Apple Game Center for leaderboard functionality. When you are signed in to Game Center, your scores may be submitted to Apple's leaderboard service. Game Center data is managed by Apple under <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not collect or store any Game Center profile information.</p>

            <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
            <p>The App offers optional in-app purchases (such as coin packs, cosmetic skin bundles, and ad removal) processed entirely by Apple through StoreKit. We do not collect or have access to your payment information. Purchase history and transaction data are handled by Apple under their privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>App Tracking Transparency</h2>
            <p>On iOS 14.5 and later, the App will request your permission before allowing Google AdMob to track your activity across other apps and websites. You can choose to allow or deny this request.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If you allow tracking:</strong> Google AdMob may use your IDFA to serve personalized ads.</li>
                <li><strong>If you deny tracking:</strong> You will still see ads, but they will not be personalized based on your activity in other apps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can change this setting at any time in <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking</strong> on your device.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is rated 4+ on the App Store. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children of any age. The App does not carry the "Made for Kids" designation because it contains third-party advertising.</p>
            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through a third-party service integrated in the App, please contact the third-party service provider directly.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
            <p>Since the App does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no server-side data to retain or delete.</p>
            <p>To remove all locally stored data (scores, stats, preferences), simply delete the App from your device. All UserDefaults data is automatically removed when the App is uninstalled.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>All gameplay data is stored locally on your device using iOS-native storage mechanisms. We do not operate any servers or databases that store user data.</p>

            <h2>International Users</h2>
            <p>The App is available worldwide. As we do not collect personal data, there are no cross-border data transfers initiated by us. Google AdMob may transfer data internationally in accordance with their privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (including the EU/EEA under GDPR, California under CCPA/CPRA, and other regions), you may have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access, correct, or delete your personal data</li>
                <li>Opt out of data collection for advertising purposes</li>
                <li>Withdraw consent for tracking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since we do not collect personal data ourselves, these rights primarily apply to the third-party services used by the App. You can exercise your ad-related rights through your device's privacy settings or by contacting Google directly.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or applicable laws. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
            <p>We encourage you to review this page periodically. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
